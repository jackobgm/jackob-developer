        BuySellGuestPost does not automatically refund payments made for cancelled orders back to your payment
        provider. Funds from order cancellations are refunded to the buyer's balance as credit and are available for
        future purchases on BuySellGuestPost. Funds returned to your balance from cancelled orders will not include
        processing fees paid.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        Deposit refunds, when available from the payment provider, can be performed by our Customer Support team. To
        prevent fraud and abuse, we limit the total amount of times users can request a payment provider refund from
        their account which is subject to review by our Customer Support team. Such refunds may be subject to an
        additional fee. If any processing fees were added at the time of purchase to create a new order, the
        processing fees from that payment will not be refunded along with your deposit.
